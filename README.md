# 🔐 Penetration Testing Labs

This repository contains my hands-on penetration testing practice labs 
based on real-world attack methodology and the Cyber Kill Chain model.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate real-world attacks in a controlled lab environment and 
document reconnaissance, exploitation, and defense techniques.

---

# 🧠 Methodology: Cyber Kill Chain

## 1️⃣ Reconnaissance
- Information Gathering
- Nmap Scanning
- Whois Lookup
- DNS Enumeration

Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Whois
- theHarvester

---

## 2️⃣ Scanning & Enumeration
- Port scanning
- Service version detection
- SMB enumeration
- Directory brute forcing

Tools Used:
- Nmap
- enum4linux
- Gobuster

---

## 3️⃣ Exploitation
- Vulnerability identification
- Metasploit exploitation
- Web app attacks (SQLi / XSS)

Tools Used:
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite

---

## 4️⃣ Post-Exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Persistence
- Data extraction

Tools Used:
- Linux commands
- Meterpreter

---

## 🛠️ Lab Environment
- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Metasploitable 2 (Target)
- VirtualBox

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Understanding attack flow
- Identifying weak services
- Practical exploitation workflow
- Defensive thinking from attacker perspective
